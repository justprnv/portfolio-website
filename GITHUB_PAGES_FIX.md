# GitHub Pages Fix - Blank Page Issue

## The Problem
GitHub Pages is showing a blank HTML file instead of your React website because it's serving the source files instead of the built files.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Use the Pre-configured Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Push the workflow file to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push
   ```

2. **Go to your GitHub repository**
3. **Click "Actions" tab**
4. **Wait for the workflow to run** (it will build and deploy automatically)
5. **Go to Settings > Pages**
6. **Make sure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"**

### Option 2: Manual Fix (If you already have a repository)

1. **Delete the old workflow** (if any):
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Delete any existing workflows

2. **Add the new workflow**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the content from the file I created
   - Commit and push

3. **Update Pages settings**:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Change source to "GitHub Actions"

### Option 3: Quick Manual Deploy (Temporary)

If you need it working immediately:

1. **Build your project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to Settings > Pages**
3. **Change source to "Deploy from a branch"**
4. **Select "main" branch and "/build" folder**
5. **Click Save**

## Why This Happened

- GitHub Pages was serving your source `index.html` (which references `/src/main.tsx`)
- Instead of the built files in the `build/` directory
- The built files have the actual JavaScript and CSS that make your site work

## The Solution

The GitHub Actions workflow I created will:
1. **Build your React app** (`npm run build`)
2. **Deploy the `build/` folder** to GitHub Pages
3. **Automatically update** when you push changes

## After the Fix

Your site will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME`

And it will automatically update whenever you push changes to your main branch!

## Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Make sure your repository is public
3. Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment
4. Clear your browser cache

**Need help?** The workflow file is already created in your project at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
